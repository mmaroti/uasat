This is a SAT based universal algebra calculator programming framework, 
you need to know java to be able to use it. Currently it does not have
any graphical user interface. It has a built in validation program, 
which calculates the number of certain structures:

```
A000110 the number of equivalences on a 7 element set is 877.
A000142 the number of permutations on a 7 element set is 5040.
A000372 the number of antichains of 2^4 is 168.
A001035 the number of partial orders on a 5 element set is 4231.
A001710 the number of even permutations on a 7 element set is 2520.
A114714 the number of linear extensions of 2x2x4 is 2452.
The number of essential binary relations on 3 is 462.
Parsing the N5 poset relation and printing its covers: passed.
Finished in 5.73 seconds.
```

I have also included small programs used for my research, you can
disregard those.
