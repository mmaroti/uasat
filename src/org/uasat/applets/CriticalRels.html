<h3>Finding critical relations in relation clones</h3>
<p>This applet can calculate or estimate the critical relations of
small arities of a finite relational structure. The generator
relations must be entered, and then the algorithm iteratively
generates relations in the relational clone using products, projections
and intersections, finds the meet-irreducible relations and determines which
of those are directly indecomposable.</p>

<p>It is not practical to really find all relations of some arity in the
relational clone,
because some relations might be generated only through some very large
arity intermediate relations. Instead, we maintain the list of possibly
irreducible relations of a given arity <tt>n</tt> (starting from the
generators) expand them to <tt>n+1</tt> arity relations in all possible
ways, compute all possible intersections and project it back to the
first <tt>n</tt> coordinate. So we only calculate those relations that
can iteratively be obtained by this process (by adding one or more extra
coordinates).
Actually, we do not calculate all intersections either, but encode an
arbitrary intersection of these <tt>n+1</tt> arity relations as a SAT
problem and use a SAT solver to find such intersection whose <tt>n</tt>
arity projection is not already represented as the intersection our
candidate critical relations.</p>

<p>You have to type in your input into the following field. Elements
are numbered from 0 till <tt>size-1</tt>, using the letter <tt>a</tt>
for 10, <tt>b</tt> for 11, etc. A tuple is a sequence of elements
(without separation), and a relation is a sequence of tuples separated
by spaces. First you have to specify the size of your relational
structure, then the arity of the meet irreducible relations you want
to find (these will be directly decomposed into critical relations).
Then you specify the list of relations in the structure, one per line.
You can change the extra number of coordinates that is used in the
generation process from the default value of 1. The format of the
input is the following:</p>
<pre>
size &lt;number&gt;
rel &lt;relation&gt;
...
rel &lt;relation&gt;
[idempotent]
arity &lt;number&gt;
extra &lt;number&gt;
</pre>
<p>For example, to find the 4-ary critical relations of the 4-element crown poset,
use the following script:</p>
<pre>
size 4
rel 00 11 22 33 02 03 12 13
arity 4
</pre>
